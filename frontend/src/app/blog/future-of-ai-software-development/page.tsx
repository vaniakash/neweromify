                  Artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), is rapidly
                  reshaping the way modern software is built. These AI systems are now capable of
                  assisting developers throughout the entire software development lifecycle — from
                  generating code and designing system architecture to writing documentation and
                  identifying bugs. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI tools
                  allow developers to focus more on solving complex problems and building better
                  products. As a result, development teams can move faster, experiment more easily,
                  and deliver software with greater efficiency.

                  AI-Powered Coding Assistants as Intelligent Collaborators

                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  AI-powered coding assistants also act like intelligent collaborators. They can
                  suggest code snippets, explain unfamiliar functions, generate tests, and help
                  troubleshoot errors in real time. This support significantly reduces the effort
                  required for routine development tasks and helps both experienced engineers and
                  beginners work more productively.
                </p>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code have already demonstrated
                  that AI can handle a substantial portion of boilerplate code, unit test
                  generation, and even code review comments. For many engineering teams, this
                  translates to significantly reduced time-to-delivery without compromising code
                  quality when paired with human oversight.
                </p>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                  However, while AI can accelerate development, it still requires human oversight
                  to ensure code quality, security, and reliability. Blindly accepting AI-generated
                  code without review can introduce subtle bugs, security vulnerabilities, or
                  architectural anti-patterns that are difficult to untangle later.

                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Looking ahead, the role of software engineers is evolving rather than
                  disappearing. Developers will increasingly guide and supervise AI tools while
                  focusing on system design, architecture, and strategic decision-making. The most
                  valuable engineering skills in this new era will centre around prompt engineering,
                  AI tool orchestration, and judging the quality of AI-generated output.
                </p>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In this new era of AI-assisted development, engineers and intelligent tools will
                  work together, enabling faster innovation and transforming how software is created
                  in the future. The engineers who thrive will be those who learn to leverage AI
                  as a force multiplier — using it to tackle more ambitious projects, ship faster,
                  and focus their human creativity where it matters most.

                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  For students and junior engineers entering the industry, this shift is
                  particularly important. Learning to work effectively alongside AI tools —
                  understanding their limitations, verifying their outputs, and directing them
                  toward the right problems — is becoming as foundational as learning algorithms
                  or data structures.
                </p>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The good news is that AI tools also lower the barrier to learning. Beginners can
                  use AI assistants to understand unfamiliar codebases, get explanations for
                  complex concepts in plain language, and receive real-time feedback on their code
                  — accelerating their growth faster than any previous generation of developers.
